Module 6 Challenge

We seek to answer the following question: "What is the weather like as we approach
the equator?"

PART 1
Analysis found in: WeatherPy.py

Using weather data from over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator, we are
seeking to create a representative model of weather across cities. Using plots, we will visually demonstrate the relationship between weather variables and latitude.

The weather variables included in the analysis are:
1. Temperature
2. Humidity
3. Cloudiness
4. Wind Speed

Each of the above weather variables will be modelled against latitude and plots
will be displayed for each weather variable. Following this, two plots for each
weather variable will be created - one for Northern Hemisphere data and one for 
Southern Hemisphere data.

PART 2
Analysis found in: VacationPy.py

For the range of cities found in the cities.csv dataset, we will:
1. Present a map that shows both the location of each city and also visually displays
the relative humidity of that city.
2. Present a dataframe ('city_data_df') that includes only cities whose weather
variables are considered ideal: INSERT IDEAL WEATHER CONDITIONS.
3. Present a dataframe ('hotel_df') that, for a range of cities, shows their country,
coordinates and humidity.
4. and 5. Find and display on a map the first hotel located within 10km of these cities coordinates. And display on this map the details presented in 'hotel_df' as
well as the name of the hotel.
