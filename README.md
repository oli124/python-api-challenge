Module 6 Challenge

We seek to answer the following question: "What is the weather like as we approach
the equator?"

PART 1
Analysis found in: WeatherPy.py

Using weather data from over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator, we are
seeking to create a representative model of weather across cities. Using plots, we will visually demonstrate the relationship between weather variables and latitude.

The weather variables included in the analysis are:
1. Temperature
2. Humidity
3. Cloudiness
4. Wind Speed

Each of the above weather variables will be modelled against latitude and two plots
will be displayed for each weather variable - one for Northern Hemisphere data and one
for Southern Hemisphere data.

PART 2
Analysis found in: VacationPy.py

For the range of cities found in the cities.csv dataset, we will:
1. Present a map that shows both the location of each city and also visually displays
the relative humidity of that city.
2. Present a dataframe ('city_data_df') that includes only cities whose weather
variables are considered ideal: INSERT IDEAL WEATHER CONDITIONS.
3. Present a dataframe ('hotel_df') that, for a range of cities, shows their country,
coordinates and humidity.
4. and 5. Find and display on a map the first hotel located within 10km of these cities coordinates. And display on this map the details presented in 'hotel_df' as
well as the name of the hotel.
